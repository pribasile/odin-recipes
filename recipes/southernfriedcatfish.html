        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><em>This fried catfish recipe is a classic Southern dish traditionally served with 
        <br>buttermilk hush puppies and buttermilk coleslaw.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound catfish fillets, cut in strips</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fine cornmeal</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix buttermilk, water, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour mixture into a flat<br>
                pan large enough to hold fillets. Arrange fillets in a single layer in the pan,<br>
                turning to coat each side. Set aside to marinate.</li>
            <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, and seafood seasoning in a 2-gallon resealable plastic<br>
                bag. Add fillets to the bag, a few at a time, and tumble gently until evenly<br>
                coated.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry fillets in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Work in<br>
                batches to avoid overcrowding, so fillets have room to brown properly. Drain on<br>
                paper towels.</li>
